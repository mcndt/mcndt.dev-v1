Reading this book offered me a great perspective on climate change and the technologies we need to avert the worst outcome. In this post, I will share with you some of those insights.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://mcndt.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mcndt.dev/about/</guid><description>About me Hello there! I&amp;rsquo;m a computer science engineer with interest in a wide range of topics, including productivity, PKM, artificial intelligence, product development and game design.
I graduate from Ghent University in 2022 with a M.Sc. in Computer Science Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. For my Master dissertation, I research the application of Physical Reservoir Computing on physiological processes in plants.
I started this blog because I want to try writing as both a creative outlet, as well as to record some of my projects and various things I learn while programming.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://mcndt.dev/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mcndt.dev/projects/</guid><description>Personal Projects Toggl Track Integration for Obsidian -- GitHub
As an avid user of both the Obsidian notes app and the Toggl time tracking service, I develop and maintain an open-source plugin integration Toggl into Obsidian, downloaded by over 1500 users to date.
The plugin is self-documented using TypeScript and makes use of the official Obsidian API and The Toggl and Toggl Reports API. Custom views are written in the Svelte 3 framework.</description></item></channel></rss>
