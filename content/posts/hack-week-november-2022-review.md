I had a lot of fun with the concept of “HACK WEEK”. If you didn't read my [previous post](/posts/hack-week-november-2022), the idea was to dedicate my free time for an entire week working towards one specific hobby-related goal. However, not everything went as planned, and I have learned some valuable lessons for future editions.

I moved through a lot of work in the first few days, while I was still full of motivation. Two nights in, I finished the first milestone I set for myself: a security upgrade and some quality of life improvements for [Noteshare.space](https://noteshare.space). Code, commit, ship. Feels great!

Shortly thereafter trouble started. I got distracted by some blog posts I had read about building a blog using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [MDsveX](https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX), and for some reason I decided to spend a significant amount of time making a mockup in Figma and then making an implementation in Svelte. Oops.

During the first weekend, I decided to put my nose down and focus on a big new feature (deleting, updating notes anonymously). To kick off, I scoped the entire programming session on Saturday and broke it down into bite-size to-do’s. On Sunday, and continuing the following week, I was able to bite off a few to-do’s in whatever downtime I had. This made starting to work a lot easier.

Since I hadn’t gotten that far during the first week, I extended for another week. Today, it’s the second Sunday, and I’m almost finished with the big feature I started last weekend. While I didn’t manage to ship it within the span of the "HACK WEEK", I’m confident I can push it across the finish line soon.

I only managed to finish two out of four milestones in the end, which means my plan was too ambitious in scope. I overestimated how willing I would be to hack away the night after a day of work. But it was also quickly apparent that I would not be able to finish all the goals anyhow, which was demotivating.

> ### 💡 Lessons learned
>
> 1. Perhaps I need to implement a mechanism to reward myself for staying focused, or for keeping myself accountable to my time.
> 2. Next time I might benefit from more clearly blocking my time committed to “HACK WEEK”, ahead of the start of the week.
> 3. Writing out a game plan ahead of time makes the tasks more approachable. It allows me to split the “hard thinking” parts and the “low-energy execution” into different sessions, which I can plan around my mood that day.
> 4. Writing out a bunch of milestones is ambitious, but I didn’t account enough for the fact that this will wear me out fast as well. Next time, the scope should ideally be smaller and doable in a week’s time.
