I have struggled to make time for personal programming projects since I started my first full-time job in September. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; graduating from university and starting a full-time job is a big life event, and it is important to find a new rhythm and work-life balance. And now, after two months, I want to reintroduce some focus on programming outside of work. That's how I came up with **"HACK WEEK"**!

The goal of my first "HACK WEEK" is to create some structured time to work on [Obsidian Quickshare](https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-quickshare) and [Noteshare.space](https://noteshare.space). There are a few goals I want to accomplish, ordered by most pressing to most ambitious:

| Goal                                                                             | Ambition | Estimated effort |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| [Upgrade encryption](https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-quickshare/issues/21)     | Low      | 1 night          |
| [Manual expire times](https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-quickshare/issues/15)    | Low      | 0.5 nights       |
| [Filename as note title](https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-quickshare/issues/24) | Low      | 0.5 nights       |
| Fixing bug reports                                                               | Low      | 1 night          |
| [Full CRUD on notes](https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-quickshare/issues/25)     | Med      | 3 nights         |
| Research Cloudflare R2 for note attachments                                      | High     | 4 nights         |

I think it would feel too much like a chore with a deadline if I would schedule each goal on a specific date. So instead I will organize the work into milestones that I can progress through at my own pace:

**Milestone 1:**

- [x] [2022-11-13] 🔐 Upgraded encryption (encryption v3)
- [x] [2022-11-13] 🍀 Store share link in frontmatter
- [ ] 🍀 Filename as note title

**Milestone 2:**

- [ ] 🐞 Properly rendering inline footnotes
- [ ] 🐞 Fix header links to same note
- [ ] 🐞 Add favicon for mobile systems.

**Milestone 3:**

- [ ] 🍀 Manually setting expire time
- [ ] 🚀 Deleting shared notes
- [ ] 🚀 Updating shared notes

**Milestone 4:**

- [ ] 🕵️ Proof-of-concept attachments with Cloudflare R2
- [ ] 🕵️ Research billing model for attachment hosting

## Planning

I predict that I will feel less motivated to work on “HACK WEEK” after a work day (I can only write TypeScript for so many hours a day 😅), so I will try to include two weekends in the hack week. Concretely, this means “HACK WEEK” will run from **11-11-2022** to **20-11-2022**.

After hack week is over, I will write a follow-up post to talk about the experience (and whether it was really such a good idea in the first place).
