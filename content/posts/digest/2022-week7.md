Last year, I decided to ditch Reddit and algorithmic feeds for [RSS](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Really_Simple_Syndication) and my own curation of blogs, newsletters, and other sources of thought-provoking reading material. Since I made the switch, I feel like I learn a lot every week.

Starting this week, I want to experiment with posting a weekly digest of the most interesting articles I found that week with a small explanation about how they inspired me.

## Bert Hubert: [Some business advice for academic startups/spinouts](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/some-academic-business-advice/)

(16 minute read)

Lately, I have been daydreaming about entrepreneurship and starting my software startup during the next five years. While it is fun to think of interesting technical challenges to solve and theorize about product-market fit, I still donâ€™t know anything about running a business.

This recent post by Bert Hubert gives an excellent primer on what business know-how it takes to run a startup. Whether you are caught by the entrepreneurial jitterbug yourself or simply want to learn how a multi-department business runs, give this one a read.

As an aside, if you want to dive deeper into bootstrap startup culture and (solo) entrepreneurship, check out the [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) forum. My passion for startups was amplified greatly reading the inspiring stories and knowledge shared in that place!
